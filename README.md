# Fiverr-Order-Scraper

I needed to get all of my deliveries from my fiverr. So I built a scraper/chrome-extension to help in a semi-automated fashion. I first tried with a headless browser/puppeteer, but kept running into bot detection. This was the fastest solution, and accomplished the job for me.

Step 1 - Install Chrome Extension
Step 2 - Visit "https://www.fiverr.com/users/{yourUsername}/manage_orders?source=header_nav&search_type=completed"
Step 3 - Click the Chrome Extension Icon to begin downloading your orders.
